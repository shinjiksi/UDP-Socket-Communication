# UDP-Socket-Communication-P1

Develop two small network applications used the so-called Berkeley Socket APIs to send and receive UDP datagrams.  The project produces two network programs named, sender and receiver, that send and receive data through the network.  The P1 code will be vulnerable to lost, duplicate, out-of-order delivery, and overrun issues.
