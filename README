You could paste any words into the send.txt ffile. 
Send.txt might need to be updated or changed in sender.c file
to any .txt file you wish, and then the words inside of the .txt file 
will be transfered to recieve.txt. The recieve.txt file replaces the words
everytime you run.

To compile
1. gcc sender.c -o sender
2. gcc receiver.c -o receiver

To run
run from receiver, then run sender. Reciever will response you. 
./receiver 4547
./sender localhost 4547
